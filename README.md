RoR--views-partials-layout-link_to-
===================================

   Create a new Rails application from scratch with two controllers. Each of the controllers 
   should use a different layout. Each controller should have at least two views. One of 
   your views should use a partial that renders data passed to it. Use the link_to helper at 
   least once in your application.
